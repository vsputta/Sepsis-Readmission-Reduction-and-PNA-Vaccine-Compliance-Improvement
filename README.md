# Sepsis Readmission Reduction & Pneumococcal Vaccine Compliance Improvement at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst

## Project Summary
This repository outlines two major quality improvement initiatives conducted at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst. The projects aimed to **reduce sepsis readmissions** and **increase pneumococcal vaccine compliance** among elderly patients in Medical ICU Units. Through a combination of data analysis, process improvements, and staff education, both initiatives led to measurable improvements in patient outcomes.

## Sepsis Readmission Reduction

### Background
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst has faced high 30-day readmission rates for sepsis patients. This project focused on improving discharge planning, enhancing follow-up care, and educating patients to reduce these readmissions.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Excel
- **Visualization**: Excel
- **EMR Integration**: Epic
- **Process Management**: Excel and Smartsheet

### Interventions & Results
The team implemented:
- **Enhanced Discharge Planning**: Standardized discharge protocols.
- **Post-Discharge Follow-Up**: Ensured follow-up within 7 days, again in 2nd, 3rd and 4th week.
- **Community Outreach**: Culturally competent care navigators.

**Impact**: Reduced sepsis readmissions by **9.8% in 3 months**.

## Pneumococcal Vaccine Compliance Improvement

### Background
Pneumococcal pneumonia is a leading cause of death among the elderly. This project aimed to increase **PNA vaccination rates** in the Geriatric Unit, particularly among patients who are at high risk.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Excel
- **EMR Integration**: Epic
- **Staff Education**: Developed materials in Simple English for both Medical Professionals and patients, create PNA Vaccine guide

### Interventions & Results
Key initiatives included:
- **Workflow Redesign**: Integrated PNA vaccine checks before discharge.
- **EMR Integration**: Automated vaccine reminders.
- **Staff Education**: Increased awareness among clinical staff.

**Impact**: Increased PNA vaccination rate by 14.2 % in 3 months%**.

## Dataset
The data used for these projects is sourced from **NYC Health + Hospitals (NYCHHC)** and includes sensitive patient information. Due to privacy regulations, this dataset cannot be shared publicly.

---

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite the progress, there were several challenges:
- **Data Access**: Limited access to accurate and complete patient histories.
- **Vaccine Hesitancy**: Addressed cultural barriers to increase patient engagement.
- **Resource Constraints**: Balancing competing hospital priorities and resource limitations.

---

## Next Steps & Future Work
- Scaling these initiatives across other hospital units.
- Implement predictive modeling for early detection of high-risk sepsis patients.
- Improve EMR integration and patient follow-up mechanisms.
